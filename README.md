# journal-entry

## Description
This app was inspired by the idea of creating a daily journal entry to organize my thoughts and goals for the day. I often find myself overwhelmed by the things I need and want to do each day, but I've come to find that writing them down helps to organize my thoughts.

## Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Heroku
- Mongoose
- Express
- EJS
- BCrypt
- MongoDB

## Notes
I spent a ridiculous amount of time figuring out how to only connect users to their specific collection of journal entry data. I finally got it to work, but I must've spent nearly two days on that.
